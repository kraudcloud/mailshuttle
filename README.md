# MailShuttle

A simple email proxying service, to host a local service with your master key to the proxy, and easily allow other services to access it.

## Configuration

The server is configured through a yaml file located at `CONFIG_PATH` (by default `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mailshuttle/config.yaml`).

You can view the parsed config with `DUMP_CONFIG=1`
